This is an open sour Java Script library to make client side form validation easier. It's very basic right now and open to contributions. Below is a roadmap of features that can be implemented. Feel free. 

- Writing the warning message.
- Expanding date validation with different options.
- Password difficulty checker


INSTRUCTIONS 

In order for the validator to work, the onsubmit="return validateForm(this)" event should be added to the form tag. 

(e.g. <form id="form_main" method="post" action="index.php" onblur="return validateForm(this)" onsubmit="return validateForm(this)"> )

Class field of the object determines the type of the validation(class="JSFV-required"). There might be multiple types of validation in one object(class="JSFV-required JSFV-date") 

All the types are listed below:

JSFV-required
JSFV-email
JSFV-date
JSFV-alpha
JSFV-numeric
JSFV-alphanumeric

If the validation will be done right after moving to a new field onblur="jsfvRealtime(this)" should be added to the tag.

e.g. 
<td class="field"><input type="text" id="date" class="JSFV-date" onblur="jsfvRealtime(this)"/>

If the field cannot pass the validation, the background will return to red, otherwise white. These colors can be changed int jsfvRealtime() function.
